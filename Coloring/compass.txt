N: Length of coloring
K: Length of contained MAS
C: Number of colors

V(K,C): The lowest N for which there is no coloring with no MAS
V(4,2) = 35


Problem
=======

For various Ks (4,5,6), as N increases, try to find a 2-coloring without
MASs by flipping coins. Keep track of if such a 2-coloring exists, what it
is, how many iterations it took to find it, and how much time that took.

With all the data, make graphs!

When done, generalize to non-monochromatic sequences. For instance,
instead of
    a a+d a+2d a+3d
do
    a     a+2d a+3d
or
    a a+d      a+3d
or
    a a+d^2 a+d^2
